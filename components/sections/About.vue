      I am a Full Stack Developer and a good design enthusiast.<br /><br />
      In 2016, after I obtained my Master's degree in Mechatronic Design, I
      decided to give up the 3D Printing industry and hardware engineering and
      learn how to code. Now, at the beginning of 2020, I consider it one of the
      best possible decisions.<br /><br />Since then I've been gaining
      experience as Frontend Developer, Full Stack Developer, and UX/UI Designer
      while working bothon individual projects and in international teams of
      several people.<br /><br />I am still developing my coding skills in
      JavaScript (mainly Vue.js, but I've also worked with React) and PHP
      (Laravel), but also soft skills required to be a team player, especially
      during remote work.
