      "Hi, I am Bartłomiej Wójcik, born in 1992, living in Poland.\n\nI've been always a new technology and good design enthusiast. In 2016 I was graduated in Mechatronics Desiging faculty from AGH University of Science and Technology. During my studies I worked for over a year in the 3D printing industry.\n\nDuring the last year of study I decided to learn how to code and try myself in IT.\n\nI get my first job in IT in November 2016 and since then I've worked as a Junior Frontend Developer, Frontend Developer, Full Stack Developer and even as a UI/UX Designer for a couple of months to extend my knowledge in that field.\n\nNow I am still developing my coding skills in JavaScript and PHP. I work with Vue.js for over 2 years almost everyday. I've also been using Laravel for some time. I wanted to have a better understanding of both frontend and backend of web applications, but still creating awesome interfaces gives me much more fun.\n\nDuring my several years of work in IT I learned how to solve problems, how to be an independent developer, but also how to be a team player."
